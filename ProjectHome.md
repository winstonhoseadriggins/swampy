Swampy is a suite of Python programs used throughout the Engineering with Computing curriculum at Olin College. It was written by Allen Downey.

Swampy includes these components:

  * Lumpy

> Lumpy stands for 'UML in Python' It is used in Software Design to provide a model of execution and to teach UML object and class diagrams.

  * AmoebaWorld

> Used in Introductory Programming to provide practice writing Python expressions and to introduce object-oriented programming.

  * TurtleWorld

> Used in Software Design to teach procedural interface design and object-oriented programming.

  * TurmiteWorld

> Used in Computational Modeling to demonstrate and allow students to experiment with cellular automata and finite state machines, including Langton's Ant. (The misspelling of 'termite' is deliberate; it is a tribute to Alan Turing).

  * Sync

> Sync is a simulator that demonstrates the execution of multithreaded programs that interact through Semaphores. It is used in Synchronization to help students test solutions to synchronization problems.

Swampy is supported by two textbooks (both available under the GNU Free Documentation License):

  * The exercises in TurtleWorld follow the order of presentation in 'How to Think Like a Computer Scientist'.

  * Sync is designed to simulate the examples and solutions from 'The Little Book of Semaphores'.
